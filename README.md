Code base for assignment 4 in PPL course.

This assignment was mainly about typechecking.
We extended our growing Scheme subset language with another form, tuples.
We then had to also extend the typechecker and interpreter to support this new form.

All of the assignments descriptions in this course can be found [here](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ppl202/Assignments).
